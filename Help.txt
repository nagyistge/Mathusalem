scan -source dirPath [-excludePath path] [-excludeName name] [--excludeHidden]
List recursively the contents of a directory.
	-source: path to directory to source
	-excludePath: one or more relative paths to exclude
	-excludeName: one or more file or directory names to exclude
	--excludeHidden: exclude files or directories hidden in the GUI e.g. starting with '.'

diff -source dirPath -target dirPath [-excludePath path] [-excludeName name] [--excludeHidden]
List the differences between a target directory and a source one.
	-source: path to source directory
	-target: path to target directory
	-excludePath: one or more relative paths to exclude
	-excludeName: one or more file or directory names to exclude
	--excludeHidden: exclude files or directories hidden in the GUI e.g. starting with '.'

sync -source dirPath -target dirPath [-excludePath path] [-excludeName name] [--excludeHidden] [--atomic]
Synchronizes the content of a target directory with a source one.
	-source: path to source directory
	-target: path to target directory
	-excludePath: one or more relative paths to exclude
	-excludeName: one or more file or directory names to exclude
	--excludeHidden: exclude files or directories hidden in the GUI e.g. starting with '.'
	--atomic: ensure the target still matches the source even if the source has changed during the synchronization

backup -source dirPath -destination path [-excludePath path] [-excludeName name] [--excludeHidden] [--atomic] [--diskImage] [--compressed] [-segment size] [-password password] [-preExecutable path] [-postExecutable path] [--dryRun]
